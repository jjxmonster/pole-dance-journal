# UI Architecture for Pole Journal

## 1. UI Structure Overview

Pole Journal follows a **mobile-first, progressively enhanced architecture** built on TanStack Start, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, and Shadcn/ui. The application is organized into three distinct security zones:

1. **Public Zone (SSR, Indexable)**: Landing page optimized for SEO and discovery
2. **Catalog Zone (SSR, Conditionally Indexable)**: Public catalog and move details accessible to all, with enhanced features for authenticated users
3. **Authenticated Zone (Private, Not Indexable)**: Personalized dashboard and account management
4. **Admin Zone (Private, Role-Protected, Not Indexable)**: Move management and content curation

The architecture employs **server-side rendering for public pages** to optimize SEO and first-load performance, while private and admin areas use appropriate meta tags (noindex, nofollow). All data fetching is managed through **TanStack React Query with oRPC** for type-safe API communication, optimistic updates, and automatic cache management.

**Core Architectural Principles:**

- Mobile-first responsive design with thumb-reachable primary actions
- Optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback on errors
- Consistent loading, empty, and error state patterns across all views
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Row Level Security (RLS) via Supabase for data protection
- Polish language UI text with architecture ready for future internationalization

## 8. Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints (Tailwind Default)

- **Mobile**: < 640px (sm)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px (sm to lg)
- **Desktop**: â‰¥ 1024px (lg+)

### Layout Adaptations

**Mobile (<768px)**:

- Single-column layouts
- Hamburger navigation menu
- Sticky bottom bars for primary actions on detail pages
- Full-width forms and inputs
- Stacked image comparisons in admin

**Tablet (768px - 1023px)**:

- 2-column move card grids
- Horizontal navigation visible (may collapse for smaller tablets)
- Forms remain full-width or slightly constrained

**Desktop (â‰¥1024px)**:

- 3-column move card grids
- Horizontal navigation with dropdowns
- Forms and content max-width centered (e.g., 1200px)
- Side-by-side layouts for comparisons

### Touch Targets

- Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements on mobile
- Increased spacing between clickable elements
- Thumb-reachable zones prioritized for primary actions

## 9. Performance Considerations

### Optimizations

- **SSR for Public Pages**: Landing and catalog pages server-rendered for fast first paint and SEO
- **Image Optimization**: AI-generated images compressed and served via CDN
- **Lazy Loading**: Images lazy-loaded as user scrolls
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting via TanStack Start
- **Debounced Inputs**: Search (250ms) and note autosave (2s) debounced to reduce API calls
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for mutations, reducing perceived latency
- **Caching**: TanStack Query caches API responses with stale-while-revalidate strategy

### Monitoring

- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, FID, CLS for public pages
- **API Performance**: Track query response times and error rates
- **User Metrics**: Track time to first interaction, successful autosaves, error rates

## 10. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- Dark mode support
- Advanced search (tags, muscle groups, prerequisites)
- Social features (sharing, following, community comments)
- Progress analytics and charts
- Video integration for move demonstrations
- Training session scheduling
- Import/export data
- Native mobile apps (PWA for MVP)
- Multi-language support (architecture ready, Polish for MVP)
- Push notifications
- Wearables integration
