# Notes System Update

## Overview

We've updated the notes system in Pole Dance Journal to provide a more comprehensive and useful journaling experience. This document outlines the changes and benefits of the new system.

## What's Changed

### Previous System:

- Single note per move
- Auto-save functionality
- No history of changes
- Limited context for progress tracking

### New System:

- Multiple notes per move
- Explicit save via "Add Note" button
- Chronological history of all notes
- Better tracking of progress over time

## Benefits for Users

1. **Progress Tracking**: Users can now see how their thoughts and abilities with a move have evolved over time.

2. **Structured Journaling**: The new system encourages more structured note-taking with discrete entries rather than continuous editing.

3. **Context Preservation**: Previous notes are preserved, giving users a complete history of their journey with each move.

4. **Improved Organization**: Separate notes for different practice sessions, insights, or tips make information easier to find.

5. **Clearer User Intent**: Explicit saving means users have more control over when their notes are committed.

## Migration Process

For existing users, we've created a seamless migration process:

1. A notification will appear for users who have notes in the old format
2. Users can trigger the migration with a single click
3. All existing notes will be preserved and converted to the new format
4. The migration is instantaneous and non-disruptive

## User Experience

The updated notes interface includes:

- A text area for entering new notes
- An "Add Note" button to save the current note
- A chronological list of previously saved notes with timestamps
- The ability to delete individual notes
- Character count display with visual indicators

## Future Enhancements

Based on user feedback, we plan to enhance the notes system further with:

- Note editing functionality
- Rich text formatting options
- Note categorization or tagging
- Search functionality
- Attachment support for images or videos
